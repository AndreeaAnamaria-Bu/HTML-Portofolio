<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Andreea Burca, a passionate and detail-oriented web developer dedicated to building dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly websites. With a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end development, I specialize in creating modern web applications that are not only visually appealing but also highly functional and efficient.</p>

<p>My expertise includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with frameworks like React and Vue.js for front-end development. On the back end, I work with Node.js, Python, and databases like MySQL and MongoDB to develop scalable and secure web solutions. Whether it’s crafting sleek landing pages or complex e-commerce platforms, I focus on delivering seamless user experiences with optimized performance.</p>

<p>With a keen eye for design and usability, I enjoy collaborating with clients and teams to bring ideas to life through code. I have a problem-solving mindset and stay up to date with industry trends, ensuring that my work is always at the cutting edge of web development. I love experimenting with new technologies and continuously refining my skills to create innovative digital experiences.</p>

<p>Beyond coding, I am passionate about sharing knowledge, contributing to open-source projects, and mentoring aspiring developers. I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and value efficiency, scalability, and creativity in all my projects.</p>

<p>When I’m not building websites, you can find me exploring new tech trends, working on side projects, or enjoying a good book. Whether you need a website from scratch or improvements to an existing one, I am always ready to take on new challenges and bring visions to life through technology.</p>
